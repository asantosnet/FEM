# Finite-Element-Method

FEM code made and used in three projetcs done at Chalmers University of Technology. Additionally, 
the CALFEM toolbox was used. Therefore, in order to run the program one must have access to that
library. In case there is any other function that I am  not able to upload to this repertory, it will
be indicated in the README file from each branch.

Select each branch for more information and to see the files inside this repository.
